# Color Detection with Voice Output on Raspberry Pi

This project detects the color of an object in real-time using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The detected color is displayed on the video feed, and a voice announces the detected color using text-to-speech.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of computer vision and speech synthesis. When an object comes into the camera's view, the system detects its color, displays the name on the video feed, and announces the color via audio output. This project is designed for educational purposes, particularly to demonstrate the integration of image processing and audio feedback.
