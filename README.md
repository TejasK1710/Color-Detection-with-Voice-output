# Color Detection with Voice Output on Raspberry Pi

This project detects the color of an object in real-time using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The detected color is displayed on the video feed, and a voice announces the detected color using text-to-speech.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of computer vision and speech synthesis. When an object comes into the camera's view, the system detects its color, displays the name on the video feed, and announces the color via audio output. This project is designed for educational purposes, particularly to demonstrate the integration of image processing and audio feedback.

## Technology Used
1. **Hardware**:
   - Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4).
   - Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB Camera.
   - Speaker or headphones.

2. **Software**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Libraries:
     - OpenCV: For real-time image processing.
     - gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): For generating the audio output.
     - Pygame: To play audio files.

---

## Hardware Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi**: Any version with camera support.
- **Camera Module**: Raspberry Pi Camera Module or a USB Camera.
- **Audio Output**: Speakers or headphones.

---

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on Raspberry Pi.
- Libraries to install:
  - OpenCV
  - gTTS
  - Pygame

---

## Installation

### 1. Set Up Raspberry Pi
- Update the Raspberry Pi:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y


### 2. Configure Audio Output
sudo raspi-config

### 3. Install Dependencies'
-pip install opencv-python gTTS pygame

### 4. Clone or Write the Script
 color_detection.py

### Usage
-Run the Script
    Start the program:
    color_detection.py
### Functionality
          Place an object in front of the camera.
          The program detects the object's color.
The detected color is:
          Displayed on the video feed.
          Announced via a speaker or headphones.
### Result
## Expected Output
         Video Feed: The live camera feed displays the detected color name on the frame.
         Voice Feedback: A voice announces the detected color name.
         For example:
         
         When a red object is detected:
         Video: Displays "Red".
         Audio: Says "Red".
